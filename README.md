# Human Comprehension of 4-Dimensional Rotation 3D and 4D Virtual Environments
To create the virtual environments the game development engine Unity was used as well as a Unity extension Engine4 for making games in 4D. There are two virtual environments one in 3D and one in 4D with the same setup. The virtual environment shows two cubes or hypercubes. The cube or hypercube on the right is fixed; it serves as the target orientation. Participants rotated the rotation cube or hypercube on the left using keyboard inputs to match the target orientation. On three sides of the cube and four sides of the hypercube, there are colored rods. The colored rods indicate rotation direction and distinguish the 192 rotationally symmetrical orientations (in N dimension there are 2n-1N! rotationally symmetrical orientations of an N-cube). On the top left of the screen is a key explaining how each button press does. On the top right of the screen was the time remaining. In 3D, there were six keys for rotating forward and backward around each of the three rotation planes. In 4D, there were 12 keys for rotating forward and backward around each of the six rotation planes.

## Install and Run Virtual Environments
The executables for the 3D and 4D virtual environments are available in the releases.

If you are using Mac download the MAC virtual environments and if you are using Windows download the WINDOWS virtual environments.

Once downloaded extract the whole folder (Windows: click extract all Mac: Open With Archive Utility)

Open the extracted folder and click it to run the virtual environment.

Allow Unknown Publisher (Windows: click "more info" then "run anyway" Mac: click "Open") The virtual environment should now run.

For Mac, you might not be able to open it because it is not from an identified developer. You will get an error message like "4D_Virtual_Environment_Mac.app" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. To fix this go to system settings then Privacy and Security and scroll down. Click Open Anyways.

## Using Virtual Environments
There is a key in the top left of the virtual environment that explains the button presses.

### 3D Virtual Environment Key
W - The blue rod rotates to the green rod

S - The green rod rotates to the blue rod

A - The blue rod rotates to the red rod

D - The red rod rotates to the blue rod

Q - The green rod rotates to the red rod

E - The red rod rotates to the green rod

just V - Reset the rotation cube

### 4D Virtual Environment Key
W - The blue rod rotates to the green rod

S - The green rod rotates to the blue rod

A - The blue rod rotates to the red rod

D - The red rod rotates to the blue rod

Q - The green rod rotates to the red rod

E - The red rod rotates to the green rod

U - The yellow rod rotates to the green rod

J - The green rod rotates to the yellow rod

H - The yellow rod rotates to the red rod

K - The red rod rotates to the yellow rod

Y - The yellow rod rotates to the blue rod

I - The blue rod rotates to the yellow rod

just V - Reset the rotation hypercube
